Spell checking through Hunspell 1.4.1 and up

## How to install?

Note: More heavily tested on 1.4.1 but works on 1.6.

Hunspell is installed by default on some systems, if it's not:
`sudo apt-get install libhunspell-1.4-0:i386`

If you wish to build (which you likely do if you're here) This also includes the necessary files above
`sudo apt-get install libhunspell-dev:i386`


Alternatively, you can find hunspell's source here: https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell/releases

For easily installed dictionary list:

`apt-cache search hunspell`

`sudo apt-get install hunspell-en-us for English (United States)`


The package requires a 32-bit version of libhunspell.so

If this doesn't exist with your OS's i386 libraries and you have libhunspell 1.4 or above installed try running:

Example for Debian:
`sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libhunspell-1.4.so.0 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libhunspell.so`

You can also use the above method to update hunspell to a newer version (may not be supported)
