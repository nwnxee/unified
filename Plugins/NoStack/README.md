Functions and variables to control stacking of multiple bonuses of the same type.

## Environment Variables

* `NWNX_NOSTACK_*`: See below.
* `NWNX_NOSTACK_SPELL_DEFAULT_TYPE`: Between 0 and 20. See below.
* `NWNX_NOSTACK_ITEM_DEFAULT_TYPE`: Between 0 and 20. See below.
* `NWNX_NOSTACK_ALWAYS_STACK_PENALTIES`: true or false. Defaults to false.
* `NWNX_NOSTACK_SEPARATE_INVALID_OID_EFFECTS`: true or false. Defaults to false.

### NWNX_NOSTACK_*

The following environment variables are available.

| ENV VAR | Description |
|---|----|
| NWNX_NOSTACK_ABILITY | Controls whether ability scores should stack or not |
| NWNX_NOSTACK_SKILL | Controls whether skill bonuses should stack or not |
| NWNX_NOSTACK_SAVINGTHROW | Controls whether saving throw bonuses should stack or not |
| NWNX_NOSTACK_ATTACKBONUS | Controls whether attack bonuses should stack or not |

Each of the variables can take one of the following values.

| Value | Description |
|---:|----|
| 0 | Default value, vanilla behavior. |
| 1 | It will prevent any kind of stacking of properties. Only the highest effect will be used. |
| 2 | It will allow both the highest item effect and the highest spell effect. |
| 3 | It will only prevent stacking of effects from items. Spell effects will stack as usual. |
| 4 | Stacking will be determined by effect type that can be set using NWscript functions. |

### NWNX_NOSTACK_*_DEFAULT_TYPE
This variable takes one of the following values, assigning all effects this modifier type by default.
This is used only when mode is set to 4. Per-spell overrides can be defined using the
`NWNX_NoStack_SetSpellBonusType(int spellId, int type)` function. Effects of different types
stack with each other but only circumstance bonuses stack with effects of the same type.

Feats and other spell-like effects use spellIds from spells.2da to determine the bonus type. Item effects will always use the default type set for all items.

| Value | Type |
|---:|----|
| 0 | Enhancement bonus. Default value for items. |
| 1 | Circumstance bonus (stacks). Default value for spells. |
| 2 | Competence bonus. |
| 3 | Insight bonus. |
| 4 | Luck bonus. |
| 5 | Morale bonus. |
| 6 | Profane bonus. |
| 7 | Resistance bonus. |
| 8 | Sacred bonus. |
| 9-20 | Custom bonus types. |

### NWNX_NOSTACK_SEPARATE_INVALID_OID_EFFECTS
Set this value to true if you are adding effects through scripts that you want to stack with each other.
This is needed because scripted effects, unless created from a spellscript, always have an INVALID_OBJECT creator and a spellId of -1.

This is a quick fix, if you want to control each of the scripted effect types you will need to unpack the effect, set a valid spellId and use the
`SetSpellBonusType()` function to set the bonus for that spellId. The spellId has to be a valid spell, so either reuse one of the existing spells
that don't give a bonus effect (i.e. healing or damaging spells) or add a dummy spell to your spells.2da.
