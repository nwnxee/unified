Funchook - an API hook library
==============================

[![tests](https://github.com/kubo/funchook/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/kubo/funchook/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)

This library depends on one of the following disassemblers.

On x86_64 and x86
* [diStorm3][] (default)
* [zydis][] (when `-DFUNCHOOK_DISASM=zydis` is passed to the `cmake` command)
* [capstone][] (when `-DFUNCHOOK_DISASM=capstone` is passed to the `cmake` command)

On arm64
* [capstone][]

TODO
----

* write documents.

News
----

### 2.0.0 (20XX-XX-XX)

* Add `funchook_prepare_with_params()` to support prehook.
* Add `funchook_get_arg()` to get arguments in prehook.

### 1.1.2 (2023-03-12)

* Experimental support for Windows arm64

### 1.1.1 (2022-10-02)

* More permissive check for page allocation mmap ([#25][])
* Flush instruction cache for arm64. It does nothing for intel CPU.
* Disassember engine
  * Upgrade capstone to 4.0.2
  * Upgrade distorm to 3.5.2
* CMake
  * Allow user to specify FUNCHOOK_CPU explicitly ([#19][])
  * Avoid polluting global include and link dirs ([#20][])
  * Use target based compile options for gcc's -Wall ([#21][])
  * Use ExternalProject_add to download captone only ([#30][])
  * Add option FUNCHOOK_INSTALL ([#31][])
  * Use "FUNCHOOK_CPU MATCHES <string>" ([#32][])
* Documentation
  * added example usage from python ([#22][])
* Fix tests on Android ([#29][])

### 1.1.0 (2020-03-22)

* Arm64 Linux support. [capstone][] is used as the disassembler library on arm64.
* Options to use [zydis][] and [capstone][] as a disassembler library on x86_64 and x86.
* `extern "C"` was added in funchook.h for C++. ([#15][])
* Libc-compatible functions were removed to simplify code.

### 1.0.0 (2020-01-19)

* [diStorm3][] is used as the disassembler library.
* Libc-compatible functions were implemented on Linux in order not to hook function calls issued by funchook itself.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

* Linux x86_64
* Linux x86
* Linux arm64 (since 1.1.0)
* macOS x86_64 (Functions in executables cannot be hooked when Xcode version >= 11.0. (*1))
* Windows x64 (except C-runtime functions under [Wine][])
* Windows 32-bit

*1 [`mprotect`] fails with EACCES.  

Tested Platforms
----------------

Tested on some versions. Not tested in CI.

* Windows arm64 (version 1.1.2)

Unsupported Platforms
---------------------

* macOS arm64 (*1)
* x64/x86 emulation for Windows arm64

*1 I received a mail that [`mprotect`] failed with `EINVAL`. Apple seems to prevent executable memory regions from being writable.

Compilation and installation
-----------

### Unix

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/kubo/funchook.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/directory ../funchook
$ make
$ make install
```

* Available [`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`][] values are empty(default), `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`(release build with debug information) and `MinSizeRel`.
* When [`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`][] isn't set, funchook is installed at `/usr/local`.

  installed files:
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/funchook.h` (header file)
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libfunchook.so` (symbolic link to `libfunchook.so.1`)
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libfunchook.so.1` ([soname][]; symbolic link to `libfunchook.so.1.1.0`)
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libfunchook.so.1.1.0` (shared library)
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libfunchook.a` (static library)

### Windows

Here is an example to compile funchook with Visual Studio 2017 Win64.
Change the argument of `-G` to use other compilers.

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/kubo/funchook.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=c:\path\to\install\directory ..\funchook
$ cmake --build . --config Release --target INSTALL
```

* Available `-G` arguments (generators) are listed in the output of `cmake --help`.
* Available `--config` arguments are `Debug`(default), `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo` and `MinSizeRel`.
* When [`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`][] isn't set, funchook is installed at `c:\Program Files\funchook`.

  installed files:
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}\include\funchook.h` (header file)
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}\bin\funchook.dll` (shared library)
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}\bin\funchook.pdb` (debug file for `funchook.dll` when `--config` is `Debug` or `RelWithDebInfo`)
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}\lib\funchook.lib` (static library)
  * `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}\lib\funchook_dll.lib` (import library for `funchook.dll`)

Example
-------

```c
static ssize_t (*send_func)(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
static ssize_t (*recv_func)(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);

static ssize_t send_hook(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags)
{
    ssize_t rv;

    ... do your task: logging, etc. ...
    rv = send_func(sockfd, buf, len, flags); /* call the original send(). */
    ... do your task: logging, checking the return value, etc. ...
    return rv;
}

static ssize_t recv_hook(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags)
{
    ssize_t rv;

    ... do your task: logging, etc. ...
    rv = recv_func(sockfd, buf, len, flags); /* call the original recv(). */
    ... do your task: logging, checking received data, etc. ...
    return rv;
}

int install_hooks()
{
    funchook_t *funchook = funchook_create();
    int rv;

    /* Prepare hooking.
     * The return value is used to call the original send function
     * in send_hook.
     */
    send_func = send;
    rv = funchook_prepare(funchook, (void**)&send_func, send_hook);
    if (rv != 0) {
       /* error */
       ...
    }

    /* ditto */
    recv_func = recv;
    rv = funchook_prepare(funchook, (void**)&recv_func, recv_hook);
    if (rv != 0) {
       /* error */
       ...
    }

    /* Install hooks.
     * The first 5-byte code of send() and recv() are changed respectively.
     */
    rv = funchook_install(funchook, 0);
    if (rv != 0) {
       /* error */
       ...
    }
}

```

Example - Using Python ctypes
-----------------------------
```python
# should work on python 2.7/3 windows/linux

# load funchook
import ctypes
fh_lib = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary('/path/to/funchook/dll/or/so')

# define signatures
funchook_create = fh_lib.funchook_create
funchook_create.restype = ctypes.c_void_p
funchook_create.argtypes = []

funchook_prepare = fh_lib.funchook_prepare
funchook_prepare.restype = ctypes.c_ssize_t
funchook_prepare.argtypes = [ctypes.c_void_p, ctypes.c_void_p, ctypes.c_void_p]

funchook_install = fh_lib.funchook_install
funchook_install.restype = ctypes.c_ssize_t
funchook_install.argtypes = [ctypes.c_void_p, ctypes.c_int]

PySys_WriteStdout = ctypes.pythonapi.PySys_WriteStdout
PySys_WriteStdout.restype = None
PySys_WriteStdout.argtypes=[ctypes.c_char_p]

# must keep those references alive, or stuff will be GC'd and weird errors will occur
global orig_write, hook, orig_write_ptr

# create hook (this function will replace the original function)
hook_type = ctypes.PYFUNCTYPE(None, ctypes.c_char_p)
orig_write = None
def hook_impl(msg):
    print('about to write: ' + str(msg)) # do what we want
    orig_write(msg)                      # call the original function

hook = hook_type(hook_impl)

fh = funchook_create()
# create a pointer object with the function address
orig_write_ptr = ctypes.c_void_p(ctypes.c_void_p.from_address(ctypes.addressof(PySys_WriteStdout)).value)
# orig_write_ptr.value will get a ptr to the original PySys_WriteStdout and PySys_WriteStdout will now point to the hook
ret = funchook_prepare(fh, ctypes.addressof(orig_write_ptr), hook)
assert not ret, 'ret is ' + str(ret)
ret = funchook_install(fh, 0)
assert not ret, 'ret is ' + str(ret)
orig_write = hook_type.from_address(ctypes.addressof(orig_write_ptr))
PySys_WriteStdout(b'hi there\n')
```
